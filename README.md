# scheduled-sms-twillio-python

# This code is based on package(in month) which is entered by users.

# Most prefered in Gym, hostel rent etc.. like that.

# This is based on twillio sms api

# The user entered date is manipulated according to the package and it is taken as expiry_date

# The condition used is the comparison of expiry_date and current_date.

# The current date is taken from online, not from system so that the system date cannot matter the project precision.

# In twillio free trail, the sender number and reciever number should be added/registerd with otp.

# Hope you could enjoy the code...
